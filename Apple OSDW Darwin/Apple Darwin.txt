# Maintained by APPLE, and the patch by ammoune78

# What is _OSI and what is _INI?
# _OSI "Operating System Interfaces – which returns supported interfaces, behaviors, and features".
# _INI "Initialize – which performs device specific initialization".

# What is this patch for?
# Well, this patch will add Darwin _OSI, so it can now be used, for devices 
# 
# that are supposed or not to use macOS, sitting or hope.
# 
# The goal is to Enable/Disable the check by the OS, so we call OSDW, telling the OS to either
# 
# or not using, reading the function, the method etc... to Go or Stop. 
# 
# This is helpful on the MoBos that have devices that are or not compatible. Or Apple, have them
# 
# On their systems, but doesn't let macOS initialize them. And this is why, they have used this
# 
# particular acpi method.

#
# Recalling the external Scope _SB.PCI0 from DSDT, where the _INI is injected
