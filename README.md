# DSDT-SSDT-Patches

Patches are needed specially when running OS X or macOS, there are multiple patches in multiple ways that you can use for your own need! You can apply some of them directly to SSDT's & DSDT files decompiled properly (it's preferable) for injecting the Device Specific Method (DSM) or OSDW or other ACPI patch methods.

#### Patches & Tweaks:
There are some methods that you can add, devices, patches for renaming devices and some fixes, removing, replacing to let you emulate Mac machines.
